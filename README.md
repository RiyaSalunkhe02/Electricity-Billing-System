Electricity-Billing-System

This project is a Java-based implementation of a Database Management System (DBMS) that facilitates user registration and login functionalities for both employees and customers. Users can sign up as employees or customers seeking new connections, and existing users can log in to access various features.

Once logged in as an employee, users can perform tasks such as generating bills for customers, adding new employees or customers, viewing employee and customer lists, updating customer details, deleting customers, or viewing all services requested by customers. Generating a bill requires specific customer identification, units consumed, payment mode, and the total bill amount.

Customers logging in can view generated bills or request new services. To request a service, customers need to provide details such as the type of service and the required service date. This project incorporates JDBC for database connectivity, SQL CRUD operations for database management, Java GUI using Swings for the user interface, and other fundamental Java concepts.
